         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>HAd Providence aſſigned unto me in mine infancy ſuch
Education as my <hi>Genius</hi> thirſted after, thou hadſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the
following <hi>Treatiſe</hi> better garniſhed with words then now it is: but
ſuch is my now natural rudeneſs, and ſuch is the ruſtical homelineſs
of thoſe people with whom I dayly converſe, my practiſe being wholy with
rural perſons, that thou mayſt not expect the work it ſelf to be better,
or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then a plain piece of Country Aſtrology, rude Collections, or
indigeſted and wholy unpoliſhed Experiments: yet I promiſe thee thou
ſhalt find truth all along in every book attending thy reading hereof: I have
been a long time in gathering my Obſervations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the work it ſelf
is the Production of time and years, and the fruits of many nocturnal
watchings; it had come out ſooner, and appeared more glorious, had not ſome
ſnarling <hi>Preſbyterian Prieſts</hi> both in publique and private,
impedited my Studies, and endeavored to blaſt my reputation (ſuch as it is)
by babbling in their Pulpits ſuch things againſt Aſtrology, as God knows
they underſtand not: maliciouſly they thunder out their Cenſures
againſt me, poor man, and I as patiently undergo them, knowing very well,
that their Kingdom is declining, it being no other then earthly, and they
themſelves of all ſorts of Prieſts the moſt raging and malicious that
ever the world produced unto the day hereof, and this is <hi>April</hi> 25.
1650.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:117348:3"/> But to the matter it ſelf of the enſuing
Diſcourſe, I have divided the work into three Parts or Books.</p>
            <p>The firſt Book contains 54. Pages, and doth inſtruct the
Learner how to verifie a Nativity, then how to judg exactly of every one of the
12. Houſes of Heaven, wherein I am very copious; as alſo in inſtructing
how to take the ſeveral Parts in every Nativity, a thing which I perceive was
omitted by Mr <hi>Lilly</hi> in his Introduction, and alſo by ſome other or
all of our late Authors, and which I could willingly my ſelf have omitted,
but that ſome young Students deſired me to inſert them; and truly, though
I do not very much attribute unto theſe Parts, in regard I am not well
ſatisfied of the Reaſon why the ancient <hi>Arabians</hi> ſo collected
them; yet have I found in many Experiments of mine own, that they have given
ſingular light unto me for all thoſe purpoſes for which they were framed,
and by me collected: I am alſo in the Judgment of every Houſe more copious
then Mr <hi>Lilly,</hi> by means whereof, the young Student carefully
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving my precepts, will much inlarge his conceptions, when he judges the
general felicity or infelicity depending on every Houſe of the
<hi>Zodiacks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond book moſt delightfully handles that Subject which
was yet never in the Engliſh Tongue, <hi>viz.</hi> what every Planet
ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth in each others Houſe, what occupation or profeſſion every
Planet, either by himſelf, or as joyned with another by any aſpect, doth
declare; as alſo the diſeaſes ſubject to ſuch Configurations: It
alſo acquaints you what occupation or magiſtery doth properly belong to
every ſign of the <hi>Zodiacks,</hi> that ſo the provident Artiſt, by
mixing the ſignification of the Planet together with that of the ſign, he
may give a very ſober and ſolid Judgment what profeſſion the Native
will naturally moſt encline unto; and this is of excellent uſe for parents,
whereby they may moſt properly fit their children with ſuch a
profeſſion as they naturally love: Beſides, I there deliver the natural
as well as accidental ſignification of every Planet; as alſo what naturally
every Planet is the ſignificator of, as poſited in any Houſe of the
Radical Scheam of the birth.</p>
            <p>The third and laſt Book containeth eleven Chapters, full of many
Curioſities, and ſuch as you ſhall not find extant in any Engliſh
Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor: And although many things herein, in this third Book, doth ſmell more
of the vulgar <hi>Arabian</hi> learning, then <hi>Grecian;</hi> yet what
<pb facs="tcp:117348:3"/> I have experimented by the ſpace of near theſe
twenty years, I could do no leſs then publiſh for thy benefit, and wiſh
thy favorable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance hereof, until I be more able to furniſh thee with
other Curioſities, now lying by me, not in this our Engliſh language, which
excellent Pieces were communicated unto me by a perſon of quality and
learning.</p>
            <p>Unto the Noble Profeſſors of this Art I have a few lines to
write, and I do moſt heartily implore thoſe which generally practiſe in
the City of <hi>London,</hi> that with much warineſs they handle or undertake
Queſtions concerning Theft, for it's a moſt difficult and laborious task,
as I my ſelf by my great experience have found; for though we deſcribe the
party or Thief never ſo exactly, yet if the Goods be not preſently retaken
with the Thief, or if the party ſo accuſed or deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by us do
complain to an ignorant Juſtice of the Peace, (as now there are many, as well
as in former time,) and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend themſelves injured, either the ſimplicity
of the Maſter, or covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Clerk, will cauſleſly bind
over the Artiſt to anſwer the fact at the next Seſſions, though there
do no party appear to make complaint againſt the Aſtrologer; which ſilly
act of ſome Juſtices is no other then an encouragement unto Thieves, and a
diſheartening to every honeſt Artiſt for endeavoring the diſcovery of
Knaves, and be ſo ſcurvily rewarded: I would willingly know, whether a
Juſtice of Peace his Clerk doth not more offend in taking 2. <hi>s.</hi> 4.
<hi>d.</hi> to bind a man over to the Seſſions, then the poor Artiſt, who
had perhaps little or nothing for his pains, for his endeavoring by lawful Art
to diſcover the Thief: Of this manner of dealing in <hi>London,</hi> I hear,
there are frequent examples, and one alſo I have known in
<hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton-ſhire</hi> of late committed by S. <hi>J: D:</hi> Kt, until
the Aſſizes; but the Artiſt at the Aſſizes was as freely diſcharged
by an honorable Judg of this Kingdom, as he was maliciouſly bound over by the
aforeſaid ſimple Juſtice; the truth is, the Juſtice was a Presbyterian,
and the Aſtrologer a great Parliamenteer, and Lover of the Army, &amp;c. But
I haſten.</p>
            <p>I would wiſh the Divines of this Nation, or whoever are
offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this Study, to argue it fairly with us, or with Love and
Charity, and to read over Mr <hi>Lilly's</hi> Works, and not condemn them, him,
or us all, or Aſtrology it ſelf, unheard, or not at all underſtood: What
a Barbariſm is this in thoſe who pretend themſelves the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
<pb facs="tcp:117348:4"/> of Jeſus Chriſt to be thus uncharitable? But
ſuch were the Prieſts in the old Law, ſuch the Phariſees in Chriſts
time, ſuch at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Presbyterian violent Prieſts.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing the God of Heaven diſcovers more Truths unto us now
living every day, then our forefathers were ſenſible of, ſhall we like
beaſts be mute, and not magnifie his holy Name therefore? Or ſhall we
refuſe to ſtudy Aſtrology, Divine Aſtrology, Celeſtial Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
becauſe it hath been very little underſtood formerly, or abuſed by ſome
former Artiſts? God forbid that the abuſe ſhould take away the pious
uſe of any creature; No: Let us magnifie the Lord God of Heaven, and admire
his wonderful Works in the Heavens; let us fear to offend his holy Name: Let us
love and obey this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, this Councel of State, and this Army, this
Power which now governs; and let us ſay, A Fig for all their Enemies: So
ſaith,</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or to judge of Aſcendants, and Nativities, after the
Traditions of the Ancient and learned Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians, it is convenient firſt
to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine the Celeſtiall figure, and in the ſame, to apply the ſeaven
Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, with the head and taile of the Dragon <hi>Lunaire</hi> together with
the part of Fortune, and the part of the ſpirit, and others, more
appertaining to the high, and notable ſignifications of the Starres: then to
ſet downe plainly the Celeſtiall figure, you muſt in the firſt place,
note the yeare, the day and the houre, with the moſt neareſt minute of time
of the Nativitie that you have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken. The number of the houres, and
minutes, you muſt ſet them downe after the manner of the numbring of the
Aſtrologians, within their Tables: alwayes ſet downe the houres
after-noone, as well by day as by
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:117348:6"/> night, and never ſay, one houre, two houres,
three houres after midnight, but number 13. houres, 14. houres, 15. af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
noone. This done, ſearch in the Ephemerides, in the Table of the yeare of
your nativity, in the right month &amp; day propoſed, the degree of the
ſigne wherein the Sun is: looke afterward in the Table of houſes, which
ſerve for the latitude of your Country, and ſearch there the ſaid degree
of the Sun under the line of the tenth houſe. And having found in the ſame
place, the ſame degree of the Sun, you ſhall find directly upon the left
hand of the ſame Table a number of houres and minutes, the which write apart.
To which number you muſt adde the houres and minutes that have beene given
you of the ſame nativity, and that which reſteth by your addition, you
muſt ſeeke in the table of houſes; and there where you find the ſame
number of houres, and minutes, comming of the ſame addition, you muſt take
to a right line the points and beginnings of the ſix houſes which you
ſhall finde marked: the which you ſhall direct upon your figure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
at the point of the tenth, and continuing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the left hand.</p>
               <p>The beginning of the other ſixe houſes, you muſt take the
oppoſite ſignes; and if it happen that the number of houſes and minutes,
come to more than twenty foure houres, it is then convenient to ſubſtract
twenty foure houres of the ſame time, and the reſidue ſeeke out, as wee
have aforeſaid. If the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

degree of the Sunne, in the Table of your Latitude, without making any other
addition, or ſubſtraction, and that when in the figure eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative:
within the which, it is needfull by all meanes to apply the moving of the Moone
exactly calculated, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the vulgar Canons of the Ephemerides, for to
verifie afterward your nativity by the houre of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; as

Nativitie.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>LEaving the Animodar of <hi>Ptolomie,</hi> and the meetings of
<hi>Schoner,</hi> and all other uncertaine waies (although they have their
Authors) to verifie the houres of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities, I will preſently follow the
method of <hi>Hermes,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by long experience, and confirmed by
<hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi> in his Centiloque, and by <hi>Abraham Aveneſrus,</hi> by
<hi>Alphonſe, Leopold, Holy,</hi> and other moſt expert Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logians.
<hi>Hermes</hi> ſaith, that the aſcendant of a nativitie hath beene the
place of the Moone at the time of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; and that the aſcendant of
the conception is the place of the Moone at the houre of the Nativity. Who
would be more neere certified of the houre and minute of a nativity, and of the
true aſcendant, it is convenient that you follow the doctrine of
<hi>Hermes,</hi> by the method following. Firſt of all that you looke into
the figure eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative, whether the Moone be above the Horizon or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath.
If ſhee be above the Horizon, count the diſtance that is betweene the point
of the ſeventh houſe, and the Moone: if ſhee be beneath the Horizon,
count the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which is from the firſt houſe unto the Moone, which
diſtance of ſignes and degrees, you muſt ſearch in the Table that
followeth, under the title of the Moone, above the Horizon or beneath, as
truely you have found in the ſaid figure. In a right line of the ſaid
diſtance, you ſhall find the time that the infant hath remained within the
wombe of his mother, in a certaine number of dayes, the which you muſt reckon
from the day of your nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty backward, and there where the number endeth, you
muſt marke the day of the conception, if the Moone be found in the ſigne of
the aſcendant eſtimative. If you find her not in the ſame place, goe
backward or forward cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine daies of your account, untill you have found the
Moone within the ſaid ſigne, not farre from the degree aſcendant in the
ſaid figure. The day conſidered, and in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117348:7"/> what houre, go forward to the Eaſt point,
the place where you have found the Moone in the figure eſtimative, and at
that houre you muſt calculate the moving of the Moone. For this degree and
minute in the which you found her, you muſt place it in the aſcendant of
your Nativitie.</p>
               <p>And to know the houre in the which the place of the Moone of the
nativity roſe to the Eaſt point at the time of the conception, take firſt
the overthwart aſcenſion of the ſaid place of the Moone, within the table
of the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of your country, in the booke of <hi>Iohn de Regio
mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi> of the ſame aſcenſion take away 90. degrees (and adde to the
whole circle, which is of 360. degrees, when the ſubſtraction cannot be
otherwiſe made) the reſidue ſhall be the right aſcenſion of the
height of the point of the Meridian circle, take afterward the right
aſcenſion of the Sun, &amp; take out by the ſubſtraction of the right
aſcenſion of the ſaid point of the Meridian, and adde 360. degrees if it
be neceſſary, and turne that which is left into houres, &amp; minutes, in
giving to 30. degrees two houres, to fifteene degrees one houre, to one degree
4. minutes of an houre, to fifteene minutes one minute of an houre: by this
meanes you ſhall exactly come to the houre of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, to the which
you muſt calculate the place of the Moone, and the ſame well calculated,
put it to the point of the firſt houſe, in the figure of the Nativitie.</p>
               <p>Divers for this verification do dreſſe and garniſh the
motions of the Planets foure figures. One of that houre eſtimative of the
nativitie, the other of the precedent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction or oppoſition of the
brightneſſe: the third, of the verification by the Animodar: the fourth of
the concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The which beſides the unprofitable and ſuperfluous labour,
erre greatly, thinking to find out the time of the conception by the Animodar
of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> the which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience from day to day ſheweth to be
falſe, and that it hath no ancient Author to maintaine it, or hath made
mention of this new doctrine being full of contention and diſproved
veritie.</p>

degrees and a halfe. Venus and Mercury, when they be neere the Sunne 11.
degrees. The Moone when ſhe is not burned, by 13. And yet you find other
termes, when you will take a Planet for to give the yeares. Then the three
ſuperiours are eſteemed burnt, becauſe they are neere the Sunne by
15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> degrees, and if they be occidentall. For when they be orientall unto
ten degrees, they are burnt from the 10. unto 15 under the beames. Venus and
Mercury occidentall, neere to the Sunne by ſeaven de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, or orientall by

               <p>THe giver of life is taken out of the principall places of the
Figure (that is to ſay) of the Sunne, of the Moone, and of the Aſcendant,
of the part of fortune, and of the degree of the laſt conjunction, or
oppoſition of lights; the which having well noted, we conſider firſt, if
the nativity be diurnall or nocturnall. For if ſhee be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urne, wee begin at
the Sunne, the which within the firſt,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:117348:13"/> tenth, or eleventh houſe, in a maſculine
or feminine ſigne, ſhall be fit to give life, if it have any giver of time
that doth regard it: if it be in the ninth, eighth, or ſeaventh houſe, it
may alſo be the giver of life, if it be in a Maſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line ſigne, and not in
a feminine; in other places it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the giver of life, but by
conſtraint. It is alwaies ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for ſuch an act, that the giver of
time regard the giver of life, otherwiſe, the ſaid giver of life ſhall be
as a perſon that hath good will to do his friend good, &amp; hath not
wherewithall; and ſo when the Sunne ſhall be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out aſpect of any giver
of time, you muſt leave it there, and go to the Moone, which may give the
life within the firſt houſe, in the ſigne Maſculine or Feminine, and
within the tenth, eleventh, ſeventh, fourth, fifth, ſecond, and third
houſe, in ſignes Feminines and not Maſculines, receiving aſpect of any
giver of time. If the Moone have not all the ſaid conditions, you muſt come
to the degree aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, if the nativitie be conjunctionall, (Conjunctionall
is ſaid the nativity, before the which laſtly the lights have beene
conjoyned) and if the ſaid degree receive aſpect of the giver of time, he
ſhall be giver of life: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe not. Wherefore you muſt examine the
part of Fortune, the which ſhall give life in the Angles and houſes
ſucceeding, with the aſpect of the giver of time, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe you muſt
come to the degree, to the which laſtly the lights have beene conjoyned: the
which within the Angles or houſes ſucceeding ſhall be giver of life, if
hee receive aſpect of his giver of time.</p>
               <p>It is here neceſſary that the giver of time have digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of houſe, or of exaltation in places of the part of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and of the
ſaid degree conjunctionall. By this order you muſt ſeeke the giver of
life, when the nativitie is conjunctionall. When ſhe is preventionall,
(Preventio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall is ſaid, afore the which laſtly the lights have beene
oppoſites) after you have conſidered the Sunne, and the Moone, you muſt
conſequently contemplate the place of Fortune, more than the degree
aſcendant, and laſtly the

&amp; ſee that it have two degrees in the oppoſition, one of them of the
Sun, &amp; the other of the Moone. The Aſtrologians command to conſider it,
that at the time of the oppoſition it hath been in the firſt houſe, or
elſewhere above the Horizon.</p>
               <p>When the Nativity is nocturnall, we follow the ſame order,
(except that firſt we conſider the Moone, ſecondly the Sunne, &amp;c.)
this giver of life, when either by directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or by profection, or by other

               <p>THe giver of time, or giver of yeares, is the ſame that hath
dignitie of houſe, exaltation, triplicity or terme in the place where is the
giver of life. As if the Sunne were in the 11. in the ſigne of Sagittarius
(there where he may be a giver of life) and Jupiter were in the ſigne of
Aquarius, he ſhall regard the Sunne of the Sextile aſpect, and looke that
he have dignity of the houſe in the ſigne of the Sunne, hee ſhall be
giver of yeares. It is then neceſſary, that theſe two things concurre
together, to the end that one Planet be giver of yeares, that is to ſay, that
he hath dignities nevertheleſſe of terme (for the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of face is not
ſufficient enough for one ſo great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect) in ſigne and degree, in the
which ſhall be the giver of life, and that he regard the ſaid giver of
life, of one aſpect or other.</p>
               <p>This giver of time, well lodged upon the point of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles,
giveth him old yeares, in point of the houſes ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding: is meanes, is
Cadents, is ſmalneſſe, and for as much as hee ſhall be long from the
beginnings of the ſaid
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:117348:14"/> houſes, ſo much the more or leſſe
hee muſt diminiſh the number of his old yeares, meanes, and
ſmalneſſe, after the difference taken of the next houſes with the
difference of yeares. And firſt of all if it be within any angle of heaven,
not alwaies to the firſt point, you muſt proceed alſo, and take in the
firſt place the diſtance of the ſaid an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, and of the next houſe
ſucceeding. Note afterward, how many degrees the ſaid giver of years is
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the point of the angle. Then take the difference of his old yeares, and
meanes, multiply this difference by the number of the ſaid elongment, and
part it by the diſtance of the ſaid angle, &amp; of the houſe
ſucceeding; that which reſteth take for the exact number of the yeares of
life, promiſed by the ſaid giver of yeares. If he be within any houſe,
ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out of the points and beginnings of the ſame, you muſt
firſt take the diſtance of the houſe ſucceeding, and of the next
cadant: then note how many degrees the ſaid giver of yeares ſhall beelonged
from the point of the ſaid houſe ſucceeding; afterward take the
difference of yeares, meanes, and ſmalneſſe, the which multiply by the
ſecond number, and part it by the firſt: the reſidue ſhall be the time
of life which was promiſed by the ſaid giver of years. If it be in Cadant
houſes it ſhall be upon the points of them, or after, he giveth but onely
ſmall yeares: Except when he is within 5. degrees neere to the point of the
ſaid angles, &amp; then you muſt reckon as it followeth. Take the
difference of the old yeares, and ſmalneſſe of the Planets that giveth
the years, and divide them into 5. parts; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward looke in which of the
ſaid 5. degrees ſhal be the ſaid Planet. For if it be in the firſt and
moſt neere the point of the angle, (that is to ſay) if he be elonged from
the ſaid angle one degree onely, then is it convenient to take out of his old
yeares, one of the ſaid 5. parts: if he be elonged by 2. degrees, you muſt
take out 2. parts: if he be elonged 3. degrees, you muſt ſubſtract 3.
parts, &amp;c. You muſt note that the Moone in the 8. gives but ſmall
yeares. And that the Sun within the 9 and Jupiter in the 11. and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:117348:15"/> in the 5. and Mercury by the whole
aſcendant, and the Moone in the 3. give their old yeares as perfectly, as if
they were upon the points of the angles: For they be places wherein principally
they do rejoyce. Jupiter, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, and Mercury within the 9. give their yeares
indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent: &amp; the Moone in the 11. gives them old. Mars in the 6. and
Saturne in the 12. they are indifferent, becauſe in the ſaid places they
greatly deight themſelves: wherefore if they were not evill, they would there
give old yeares.</p>
               <p>Upon this purpoſe it is alſo convenient to note, that one
burnt Planet cannot be a giver of yeares: and the Moone in the prime of the
beames of the Sunne, cannot give life nor time. If a Planet, which otherwiſe
may be a giver of years, be burnt in his proper houſe or exaltation,
receiving there the Sunne cauſeth the Sunne to take the charge to be the
giver of yeares. If it come to paſſe that the Sunne or the Moone be in
their proper houſes or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altations, they may be givers of life &amp; time
together, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out need to deſire aſpect of any other Planet. If one place
being ſignificator of life, have many givers of years, wee will take him that
hath moſt dignities in the ſame place, and if they be equall in dignities,
we will take him that hath his aſpect moſt whole, and his beames moſt
neereſt the ſaid giver of life. If they find two or three, or many givers
of life, that have their givers of yeares, they muſt alwayes conſider and
direct, as the firſt and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall, following the yeares of the
Planets.</p>

ſmall yeares, (that is to underſtand) the Sunne 10. and 9. Venus 8. the
Moone 25. &amp;c. Likewiſe, if the giver of time be conjoyned with any fixed
ſtarre of amiable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it taketh of the ſaid ſtarre the number of the
ſmall yeares of the Planet, of the which the ſaid ſtarre holdeth his
nature. If the ſaid planets regard the giver of time with an evill aſpect
with reception, they adde as before, which they do not when they have no
reception. Except Jupiter and Venus, that in every ſort of aſpects, with
reception or without reception, alwaies adding to their ſmall yeares, for to
ſee that the giver of time be not Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne or Mars, towards the which the
reception is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, if the aſpect be of enmity.</p>
               <p>The ſaid planets evill placed and infortunate, in the place of
the whole ſmall years, in adding the halfe, or the third, or fourth part, or
certaine number of moneths, of weekes, or of dayes, according to the
greatneſſe or ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their infelicity. The amiable aſpects
of ill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, with reception, give their yeares ſmall: without reception,
they do neither good nor evill. If the giver of yeares be retrograde or
meridionall deſcending, or in his fall or detriment, or in the way burned,
that taketh from it the fift part of that which hee had given being
other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diſpoſed. That which happened alſo to the 3. ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our

and when ſhee is in the 20. and 9. degree of a ſigne, and when ſhe is

the giver of light, they take away the number of their ſmall yeares: except
they recover; for then by oppoſition they do but halfe the evill: by quadrate
aſpect they diminiſh but the fourth part. The taile of the Dragon taken

Moon, and Mercury fortunate in the firſt houſe, or neere to the giver of
life, adding to their ſmall yeares, although they do not regard the giver of
time: and to the contrary, that the infortunes in the ſaid places, take away
the ſmall yeares, without regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ſaid giver of time. Except when
they were well honored in the ſaid places, or when they were Lords of th

               <p>HOw to know the felicity or infelicity of the ſpirit, &amp;
the nature of the ſame, you muſt look in the place of Mercury and of the
Moone, the Planet that in theſe two places hath moſt dignities, ſhall be
ſignifier of the ſpirit. The which if it be Saturne well diſpoſed,
ſhall ſignifie the man of a great &amp; profound knowledge, of good
counſell, &amp; of good gravity, or a ſtrong opinion: cloſe, ſecret,
ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, diſſembling his good and evill, a lover of juſt men, &amp;
of good age: rejoycing upon the treaſures, heritages and labourings; holding
diſcourſe of antiquities, and of great affaires, admirator of buildings.
Sometimes a little merry, incontinent, ſad, ſometimes laughing or murmuring
by himſelfe alone, a little ſloathfull, a little envious, and not alwaies
keeping his promiſe. If hee be unfortunate, he ſhall be noted envious,
ſad, ſolitary, fearfull, melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholie, faint-hearted, a railer, jealous, a
malefactor, evill, a blaſphewer, a lyer and deceiver, an-uſurer, and holder
of opinions: rejecting the counſell of others: fearing that all the world
doth deceive him: uncivill, a villaine, a ſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin, diſhoneſt, flying the
company of men, unleſſe it be to deceive them, and to draw any profit,
having no other friend but his villainous gaine, uſing ſometimes
ſorcery.</p>
               <p>Jupiter ſignifier of the ſpirit, well diſpoſed, ſhewes
the man ſweet, curteous, honeſt, gracious, amiable, faithfull, pitifull,
liberall, of good behaviour, of good heart &amp; good love: following
nobleneſſe and all honeſty: loving God abounding in friends, dreaming
alwayes upon ſome ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous thing, and withdraws himſelfe, ſometimes
ſolitary, to think upon ſome goodneſſe: uſing in all and by all his
affaires, a great equity, prudence, and modeſty, having great courage to
accompliſh. If he be unfortunate of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and not to meet with other
ſtarres in the place of good love, he will give ſometimes
fooliſhneſſe in the place of honeſty, pride in the place of liberality,
prodigality in the place of loving good will, doth yeeld him an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:117348:17"/> ſeeming to follow nobleneſſe, when
indeed he will diſpraiſe all the world: in the place of honeſty, it will
make him dreame of tyranny.</p>
               <p>If the ſaid Jupiter be unfortunate of other Planets, and not
of himſelfe, he taketh all their vices, and covereth them with his ſaid
vertues in manner of an evill hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite. If Mars well fortunate be the ſaid
ſignificator, he ſhall cauſe the man to be of a high courage, hardy,
irefull, furious, a hazarder, conductor of warres, and the firſt in
buſineſſe, and only in deeds, and cogitations given to armes: ſtrong,
ſtubborne and mighty, truſting too much to his owne puiſſance, not
fearing any perill, and bleſſed in all his deeds. If he be unfortunate, it
maketh the man timerous, a theefe, a lyer, blaſphemer, mutinous, cruell, a
murtherer, hardy, proud, arrogant, not to be borne withall, deſpiſing his
owne proper goods, and the goods of other, uſing force and violence againſt
his Parents, and againſt all the world; a devilliſh man, without ſhame,
without counſell, without vertue, without love, without any feare or
reverence of God, furious, ſeditious, given and prompt to all
miſchiefe.</p>
               <p>If the Sunne be ſignificator in his good diſpoſition, it
makes the man mannerly, wiſe, prudent, of good counſell, a lover of
nobleneſſe, following glory, and honour, given to juſtice and governments
of Townes and Cities, loving hunting, worthy, and of great eſtimation. If it
be unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, it ſheweth great pride, exceſſive ambition, and
ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, and doth nouriſh the thought.</p>
               <p>If Venus ſignifie the quality of the ſpirit, and good
diſpoſition, it maketh the man pleaſant, merry, dauncing, laughing
content, amiable, gracious, of good converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a little jealous. If
unfortunate, it maketh the man frowning, and too merry, of evill maintenance,
uſing diſhoneſt words, given to voluptuouſneſſe, and jealous of
that which belongeth not unto him.</p>
               <p>If Mercury be fortunate, it gives good underſtanding, good
memory, great perſeverance, great ſubtiltie of ſpirit,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:117348:18"/> good diſcourſe of reaſon, full of wit,
very apt to know the Mathematicals, &amp; the ſecrets of nature; it makes the
man a Poet, an Orator, well ſpoken, writing well, and a great trader. If it
be evill diſpoſed, it makes him preſumptuous, of little knowledge, with

re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the ſaid ſignifications good and vicious, after the quality of
their good and evill diſpoſitions.</p>
               <p>If any Planet be participant in the ſignification of the
manners, or if it have great communication of aſpect with the principall
ſignificator, then conſidering the vices and vertues of him, that
(according to his good or evill diſpoſition) we do joyne them to him which
giveth the principall, as if Saturne well diſpoſed, be principall
ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficator, and Mars unfortunate be participant, or regard Saturne of one
whole aſpect with reception, then it is convenient to mingle ſome little of
the nature of Mars unfortunate, with the ſignifications of Saturne
fortunate.</p>
               <p>The Aſtrologians do advertiſe us, that if the Lord of the
aſcendant be well placed, and the ſaid ſignificator of manners evill
diſpoſed, you muſt more conſider upon that which the Lord of the
aſcendant ſignifieth, than upon that which the ſaid ſignificator doth
promiſe. Moreover, they conſider more particularly, the place of Mercury,
&amp; of the Moone, and the aſpect which they receive. If Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury be in the
aſcendant, it maketh the man ingenious, and of great and profound knowledge,
a great Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, a Mathematician, an Orator, a Poet, a Divine;
prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally when he is in the place in the which Saturn hath at the leaſt 4.
dignities, or when he receives aſpect of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:117348:18"/> Mercury in the twelfth, receiving aſpect
of the Moon hath very neere as great force for to give wit, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as
if he were in the firſt. And where that Mercury is, if he regard the Moone,
and both two, or the one, or the other, regard the aſcendant, or the Lord of
the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, this is ſigne of a good and ſubtile ſpirit. And if
Saturne, Jupiter and Mars, or other Planets, do commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to him their
favourable beams, if they mingle their good vertues, if they regard the evill
aſpect, they inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingle their vices: except Jupiter &amp; Venus, which of
evill aſpect do never anoy them, &amp; leſſe when he hath reception.</p>
               <p>If the Sunne be temporall light, it may ſignifie the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the ſpirit with the Moone, and Mercury in the forme aboveſaid. If
Mercury be occidentall within the houſe or exaltation of the Sunne, having
aſpect of the Moone or of the aſcendant, or of his Lord, it is the
ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne ſigne of good &amp; high ſpirits, of men of all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
given to great enterprizes and vertues, as Poets, Orators, Mathematicians,
Counſellers, Adminiſtrators of Common-weales, and Governours of Realmes:
prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally when he is fortunate in every angle of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Mercury within the ſeaventh houſe fortunate, giveth good
underſtanding, and ripe judgement: it maketh the man ſubtile, watchfull,
and of Good counſell, with great craft to governe his affaires. Mercury in
the ninth or third houſe, giveth knowledge and contemplation. The part of the
underſtanding of the ſpirit with their Lords fortunate, ſignifieth good
ſpirits and good manners.</p>
               <p>Mercury in the ſigne of Piſces, doth not any way love
learning: the contrary happeneth, when he is in the figne of Virgo, and of
Gemini, by all the places of the ſigure of Heaven. Saturne within the
houſes of Mercury, is alwaies contemplative: Mars, a little deceiver. Mercury
within the houſes of Saturne fortunate, is alwaies ſtudious, within thoſe
of Mars, he is full of evill words, and often falſe.</p>
               <p>When the lights and ſignificators of manners ſhall be
oppreſſed with ill fortunate, the child ſhall be of a very
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:117348:19"/> ſtrange and perverſe nature. The Moone
oppoſite to the Sunne, makes him hate all men. If the Sunne and the Moone
with the aſcendant and his Lord, be all in femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine ſignes, the manners of
him ſhall be feminine, and he ſhall be a man of little heart. If they be in
ſignes maſculine at the nativity of a woman, her deeds ſhall be manly,
and ſhe ſhall be a woman of great enterpriſe.</p>
               <p>If Venus be in the ſigne of the Lyon, or under the beames of
the Sunne, or in conjunction or other aſpect of Mars, ſhe maketh that the
man ſhall be ſuddenly ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in love. And if in that eſtate ſhe be
within the firſt or tenth houſe, without any aſpect of Jupiter, he
ſhall be vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous without having ſhame; and when ſhe ſhall be in the
ſigne of Scorpio, the aſpect of Jupiter towards Venus, giveth alwaies
chaſtity and love of vertue.</p>

               <p>FOr the riches and poverty, it is convenient firſt that you
looke to the ſecond houſe, for if ſhe and her Lord be fortunate, we ſay
that child ſhall be rich, and if they be unfortunate, he ſhall be poore on
that ſide. Then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward you muſt conſider the part of Fortune, the
which with his Lord well diſpoſed, promiſeth great ſtore of goods,
without other witneſſe. If they be evill diſpoſed, you muſt come to
the part of goods the which with his Lord fortunate enricheth, unfortunate
giveth nothing. Likewiſe you muſt judge of the part of felicity and of his
Lord. And that things which the other places ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, you muſt alwaies
have recourſe to the naturall ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator of riches, which is Jupiter,
the which well placed, &amp; fortunate, giveth goods in abundance: principally
if he be Lord of the Nativity, or Lord of the houre, or of the aſcendant, or
of the ſecond houſe, or of the part of fortune, or of the part of goods, or
of the part of felicity, or of temporall light, or of the tenth houſe,
otherwiſe he giveth nothing.</p>
               <p>When the aboveſaid Significators ſhall be unfortunate,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:117348:19"/> the child cannot be rich, if the tenth
houſe (of the which we will ſpeake hereafter) do not promiſe him ſome
good luck. Men find alſo ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by experience, that when a planet is within
his own houſe or exaltatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or in his joy, (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being unfortunate, or
elſe where environed with the fortunes or their beames) that he giveth goods,
although he be not Significator of riches. If in the fourth houſe be his
Lord, or other fortunate Planet, he promiſeth inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances. If any fixed
ſtarre of the firſt or ſecond greatneſſe be joyned to the temporall
light, or to the degree aſcendant, or to the points of the other angles, or
to other Planets in the ſaid places placed, ſhe doth raiſe the man of
baſe eſtate, to great authority, and honour: and if he be of the race of
Princes, it will make him a puiſſant Lord &amp; King.</p>
               <p>When a like planet ſhall be Lord of the aſcendant, and of
the ſecond houſe, the child ſhall be covetous of money and gaine, as that
which happeneth when Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corne is aſcendant. When the Lord of the ſecond
houſe ſhall be within the firſt, the goods come without labour.
Likewiſe when the Lord of the ſecond houſe giveth ſtrength to the Lord
of the aſcendant. When the Lord of the aſcendant ſhall be in the
ſecond, the goods ſhall not come without travell; nor when the Lord of the
aſcendant ſhall give ſtrength to the Lord of the ſecond. Saturn, Mars,
Mercury depraved, the Sunne and the taile of the Dragon Lunary, within the
ſecond, deſtroy the man, and diſperſe his goods: except when they have
at the leaſt foure dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, or when they be received. When the Lord of the
aſcendant ſhall regard with evill aſpect the ſecond houſe, or the
part of goods and of fortune, or their Lords, the child of his owne proper will
ſhall diſperſe his goods. If the Lord of the aſcendant be unfortunate
in the ſecond houſe, the child ſhall be too large a giver, and prodigall.
If any misfortune have domination upon the aſcendant, and in the ſecond,
the child ſhall be deſtroyed by others, which ſhall deſtroy his goods,
and rob him. When the ſaid ſignificators of goods ſhall be unfortunate,
the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:117348:20"/> child ſhall be all his life in paine and
travell, without any advancement or profit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abraham Aveneſre</hi> ſaith, that if the Lord of the

alwayes poore. And <hi>Hermes</hi> ſaith, when the Lord of the profeſſion
(of the which we ſhall ſpeake in the 27. chap.) ſhall be burnt, or
retrograde, or in the 6. or 12. houſe, and not any planet regarding the

Jupiter, Venus, and the head of the Dragon in the ſecond, all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes enrich.
Venus in the fifth promiſeth ſome good. The Sunne in the ninth fortunate,
giveth benefices, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goods of the ſide of the men of the Church. Mars
in the ſixt well diſpoſed, giveth good or nouriſhment to Beaſts, and

in regarding the ſituation of the ſaid ſignificators, wee will know by
what meanes ought to come the good and the evill. For if the ſignificator be
in the firſt houſe received and fortunate, it eaſily inricheth the
perſon by his induſtry and proper labour: and if hee be in the ſaid place
unfortunate, it is that his induſtry, and labour doth profit him nothing; and
the ſooner from thence to loſſe and damage.</p>
               <p>If he be in the ſecond houſe well diſpoſed, it profiteth
to talke with Merchants, and lend merchandize and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and of them make
gaine. And if he be there evill di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed, the ſaid buſineſſe
bringeth great damages. If he be within the third houſe fortunate, it
bringeth the goods from the ſide of brothers and ſiſters, and couſins,
&amp; allyes, or from the ſide of the men of the Church in taking charg of
their affaires: or to traffique here and there about his Country. If he be in

and predeceſſors, of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:117348:20"/> laboring and tilling of ground, of houſes,
&amp; oftentimes doth meet with treaſure. If it be within the fift, it
profits to be a good dancer, a good Player, to be brave, gracious, pleaſant
and delightfull, and ſometimes to be voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: alwaies well, becauſe of
God-fathers, and God-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and of their proper children; or becauſe of

that come appertaining to bravery and voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and making ready
delicates, odours &amp; perfumes, of this houſe they very ſuddenly draw

ſhall make his profit in nouriſhing, and buying and ſelling of ſheepe,
muttons, and other ſmall beaſts, or ſhall become rich by the diligence
and faithfulneſſe of his ſervants, or ſhall gaine by the exerciſe of
Phyſicke. The Gaolors, and others, which have the charge of priſons, draw
often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times their profit from this houſe.</p>
               <p>If the ſignificator be in the ſeventh fortunate, it

Church, or by traffique and travelling in ſtrange Countries.</p>
               <p>If it be well in the tenth, he ſhall have his profit of the

               <p>If it be within the eleventh, in good diſpoſition, he

in the which they be, you muſt judge the ſickneſſe to be in the place
marked by the ſaid ſigne. As if Saturne were in the ſigne of Libra, it
denoteth that the ſicknes is in the reins of the nature of Saturn; becauſe
that Libra is the ſigne that hath government over the reines, as ſhall be
declared in the ſecond Booke. Likewiſe you muſt judge of other
ſignificators, after the government of the ſigne in the which they be.</p>
               <p>The ſickneſſe and accidents comming by Saturne, Mars and
other Planets, ſhall be explained in the ſecond booke. Mars in the
aſcendant, giveth alwaies ſome notable hurt upon the face, or upon the
head, and often neere the eyes, when he is neere the lights. Saturne in the
firſt houſe, yeeldeth the man to be very ſadde, and melancholy, and
vexeth the mind, cauſing horrible ill, and fearfull imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. The taile
of the Dragon in the firſt, darkneth much the ſight, and often yeelds the
men blind, when the Luminaries or the fortunes do not intermingle their
fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:117348:25"/> beames. Saturne and Mars in the tenth,
ſignifie ſickneſſe in the necke, in the ſeventh, in the buttockes: as
Fiſtulaes, Emrods, Ulcers, and hurts, &amp;c. In the ſixt, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes in
the feet: in the twelfth, hurts, and griefes in the legges, as I have often
tryed. Saturne infortunate, ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth diſeaſes in the parts
appertaining to Saturne. Jupiter and the other, ſignifie as much, when they
be evill diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Of the parts which belong to the Planets we will
ſpeake of in the ſecond Booke.</p>
               <p>They which have the Luminaries, or any of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall places
in the figure unfortunate in the ſigne of Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio, are ſubject to the
French-pox. The ill fortunes in the ſigne of Gemini, give alwayes ſome
great and violent blowes upon the ſhoulders, legges and armes. The Moone
unfortunate in the ſigne of Aries ſignifieth great paine in the head.
Saturne and Mars joyned to the Luminaries, or to the Lord of the aſcendant,
trouble the ſight, and ſpoile the eyes with ſome blow. The Sunne in the
Nativities Diurnes, ſignifieth the right eye, the Moone the left: in the
Nocturnes, to the contrary. If the degrees of the firſt houſe, or the
Luminaries be joyned with any trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſtarre, the eyes ſhall be
darke, and the ſight trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; likewiſe if they be in the ſignes which
the Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers call <hi>Azemenae,</hi> and filthy dregges, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Saturne in the ſixt houſe burned in a watry ſigne,
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noteth ſome forme of leproſie. Saturne in the aſcendant, maketh ſome
notable deformity in the face, when hee is neere the Moone. The ill fortunes
and the Moone, and Venus in watry ſignes, ſignifie leproſie, ulcers, and
cankers on the body, and villainous ſpots in the face. Saturne in the ninth,
and the Moone in the eight unfortunate, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note trouble of mind and folly.
Venus joyned to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury unfortunate by Saturne or Mars, without aſpect of
Jupiter, or of the Sun, ſignifie notable griefe in the parts of generation.
If Venus and Mercury be under the beams of the Sunne, they ſignifie as much.
Saturne with the Moone burned, cauſeth palſies and impoſtumes. Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:117348:25"/> unfortunate, giveth alwayes ſome
impediment in the tongue, and ſo doth Saturne alſo, when he is unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
in the temporall lights. The Sunne unfortunate, denoteth weakneſſe of the
heart: principally when he is Lord of the 6. houſe, or Lord of the part of
ſickneſſe. The ill fortunes with the taile of the Dragon, cauſe
looſneſſe, and the flixe of the belly. They that have the Sunne, or Mars
in the ſignes of Aries or Gemini, be ſubject to the Stone. The
retrogradation, and burning of Saturne, and Jupiter, ſpoyle the hearing and
the teeth.</p>
               <p>When the Moone, and Mercury do not looke between them, and do
not regard the aſcendant, nor the Lord of the aſcendant, the child ſhall
be troubled in his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. The retrogradation of all the five
planets, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth the falling ſickneſſe. The ill fortunes joyned in
the aſcendant in evill aſpects of the Moone, or the Lord of the
aſcendant, denote entire folly. The part of ſickneſſes with his Lord
fortunate, preſerveth from ſickneſſe, unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, give many

ninth, ſignifieth that the man ſhall hate his wife, not ſo much for the
vice which he ſhall find in her, but of a deſire to be ſolitary. The
Significators of marriage unfortunate, or within the the houſes Cadents,
ſignifieth the woman to be of a ſinple race, or the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band in the

               <p>If Venus and the Lord of the ſeaventh houſe, joyne with the

ſignificators of marriage within the third or ninth, or elſe where
Peregrines, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that he ſhall marry out of his Country. The fortunes

ſignification of the place of the which they be Lords. If they be
unfortunate, they ſignifie evill. That is to underſtand, the Lords of the
Triplicities of vitall places, will ſignifie of the life: of the places of
fortune, riches and profit: of places of honour of the honour: good or evill,
according as they be fortunate or unfortunate at the houre of the

that would know the houre and minute of the revolution, he muſt looke in the

               <p>If the Ephemerides do not ſuffice you for this matter, go to a
Table made for the ſame purpoſe, by <hi>Peter Pitat,</hi> in the begining
of the ſame Ephemerides, by him corrected and augmented. <hi>Jerom

               </head>
               <p>FIrſt, looke how the Separator of life is diſpoſed in the
figure of the revolution, for if he be unfortunate, hee denoteth ſicknes, and
other dangerous accidents: If he be
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:117348:56"/> fortunate he holdeth him healthfull &amp;
glad all the yeare. So likewiſe you muſt judge of the Separator of goods,
friends, dignities, &amp; other effects. It is to underſtand, that they give
good fortune in the ſaid ſignifications, if they be well diſpoſed: or
elſe loſſe and evill fortune if they be unfortunate.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, looke if the Lords of the Triplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the vitall places be well diſpoſed, &amp; of places which ſignifie
riches, honour, travels, brethren, Parents, wives, &amp; children, do ſo
much. For in the ſame ſignifications the man ſhall be happy or unhappy,
according as the ſaid Lords ſhall be well or evill diſpoſed. And
principally you muſt conſider the Lord that ſhall raigne over your age;
for the 1. Lord of one triplicitie governeth the firſt age; the 2. the
middeſt of the life; the 3. the latter yeare.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, you muſt conſider which is the Planet which
governeth over the yeare of your age, that which the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians call
<hi>Fridaie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Lord of the ſigne, in which ſhall come the
ſame yeare of perfection.</p>
               <p>In the fifth place, the Lord of the circulation, accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by
the Lord of the houre of the Nativity.</p>
               <p>Then the Lord of the circulation, accounting by the Lord of the
aſcendant of the nativity.</p>
               <p>And if in the aſcendant of the nativity there be any Planet,
you muſt likewiſe make circulation.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, you muſt looke if any Planet returne to the
ſame ſigne &amp; houſe in the which it was at the nativity; for then it
intendeth the ſame effect which it hath ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the nativity,
principally-when it returneth to the ſame ſigne. You muſt alſo have
regard to the aſpects which are made in the revolution, if they be like to
them of the nativity; for that ſhall be a renuing of the effects of the
ſaid aſpects. And you muſt not forget the changing of the places. For if
a happy planet be in the revolution in the place where an evill Planet was in
the nativity, the evill ſignified by the ſaid evill Planet in the nativity,
ſhall be deferred that yeare by the preſence of the happy Planet.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:117348:57"/> To the contrary, if a Planet promiſe any
good fortune in the nativity, and in his place in the revolution be any
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Planet, the ſame good ſignified in the nativity, ſhalbe
diminiſhed in th revolution, or loſt by reaſon of the ſaid ill fortune.
The miſ-fortune in the places of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune augmenteth the evill: the good
fortunes in the places of good fortune, augmenteth the good fortune.</p>
               <p>For to judge of the ſaid conſiderations, you muſt have
recourſe to that which we have ſaid in the two former Bookes of generall
and particular ſignifications of the Houſes, Signes, Planets, Aſpects,
and particular ſituations of the Planets in Signes and houſes: having
alwaies before your eyes, the diſpoſition of ſtarres in the figure of the
Nativity. For if a Planet be in the Nativity greatly unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, and in the
revolution well diſpoſed, it cannot much profit becauſe of the first
infelicity.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe, you muſt judge of thoſe which be fortunate in
Nativities, which being unfortunate in revolutions, do no great damage. There
be ſome that contemplate here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, many other things, the which by
experience I have often found unprofitable, falſe and ſuperfluous.</p>

or good or evill diſpoſition, &amp; ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the place, of which
ſhall be the ſaid profecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that is to ſay, of the places of life,
ſickneſſe, death, or good health; of the places of goods, riches,
loſſe, or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, &amp;c. Commonly they ſeeke the profection of five
places of one nativity, that is to ſay, of the place of the Sunne for honour;
of the place of the Moone for the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the ſpirit, towards the body
and externally goods; of the place of the part of fortune, for gaine, and
profit; of the tenth houſe for the actions; of the aſcendant for the
life.</p>
               <p>If the Sunne be giver of life, it muſt be conſidered as
giver of life, and giver of honour likewiſe, the which you muſt do alſo
in other places, when they import many ſignifications. If then you find any
planet within the thirty degrees of your profection, &amp; would know what
moneth or day the accident by him ſignified ſhall happen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Looke what diſtance you have betweene the firſt point
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:117348:59"/> of your profection, and the faid Planet, if
there be 15. degrees betweene them, the ſaid accident ſhall happen out in
the end of ſixe months: if there be twenty five de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, at the end of ten
moneths, for here two degrees and an halfe, value one moneth, one degree
valueth twelve daies, and foure houres, thirty minutes value ſixe daies, five
minutes one day.</p>
               <p>Of this there is a very exact Table among the docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of
<hi>Peter Pitat</hi> upon the Ephemerides. Example of the profections.
Suppoſe that the aſcendant of a nativity was the fifteenth degree of
Scorpio, I would know where the profection ſhall light of the aſcendant at
the end of ten yeares after the child borne. I account tenne ſignes from the
aſcendant, after that, I find the fifteenth degree of Virgo ſerving after
ten yeares, accompliſhed to 11. currant. I ſay then that in the ſaid
time, the profection of the aſcendant is come in the fifteenth degree of
Virgo, &amp; ſhall end that yeare in the fifteenth degree of Libra: and
alſo ſhall contain thirty whole degrees, within the which if any Planet be
found, it ſhall ſignifie good or evill of the life, according to the nature
and diſpoſition, as if in the ſaid time.</p>
               <p>Mars being in the fifth degree of Libra, I would ſay that the
infant ſhould be troubled that yeare at the end of eight months, becauſe
that Mars was in the place profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionall of life, diſtant from the firſt
point twenty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. We have ſhewed before, that two degrees and an halfe
value one month, five degrees two months, and fifteene degrees ſixe months,
and by courſe, twenty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees eight moneths. You muſt note, that the
profecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ought to fit to the yeares currant or compleat. It is to be
underſtood the tenth ſigne, as for incontinent after nine yeares compleat,
which is ten yeares currant, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>COncerning the particular meetings of all the yeare,
<hi>Ptolomeus, John de Regiomonte, Ganrique,</hi> and many others, do reſt
hard upon the Profections, Menſturnes, and Diurnes, of the which you have a
perfect Table in the Booke of directions of <hi>John de Regiomonte,</hi> having
more ſubtilty and curiouſneſſe than truth, as I have often found by
experience. It anſwereth better my opinion <hi>Schonor,</hi> which every day
conſidered, if any planet touch the places of the Planets, parts &amp;
houſes, of the nativitie, or their good or evill aſpect, that I do apply to
the places profectionall. As for example, let the aſcendant of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
or the place of his profection be the twelfth degree of Libra, the Sunne in the
fifteenth of Gemini, Mars in the fifteenth of Leo: alwayes, and as often as the
Sunne, or the Moone do paſſe over the 15. degree of Leo, the man ſhall be
moved by angry accidents, as of diſpleaſure, of ſome alteration, paine of
the head, fevers, hot impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthumes, tetters, &amp;c. Likewiſe when it
toucheth the fifth degree of Scorpius, or of Taurus, there where the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drate
aſpects be within the place of Mars, or the fift of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarius, which is the
place oppoſite to Mars. If any Planet touch the fifth degree of Libra, or of
Gemini (there where the Sextile Aſpects be) or the fifth of Sagittarius, and
of Aries, (which make the Trine Aſpects of the ſaid Mars) it ſhall
ſignifie ſome favourable meetings of Captaines and men of warre.</p>
               <p>If the ill fortunes touch not the ſaid twelfth degree of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:117348:60"/> Libra, as we have ſaid in the
Aſcendant, that ſhall be ſigne of ſome evill meeting, as well to life
as to the body. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe you muſt judge of other attouchments, according
to the nature of the aſpects by us explained, in the ſecond Booke. You
muſt contemplate the places profectionals. For I do apply every degree and
minute to the dayes in the which their ſignification fall, and regard the
good and evill aſpects of the Planets every day, if they touch the degree
profectionall. As for example, of the ſaid nativity in the which was the
Aſcendant Libra, ſuppoſe that the profection was come to the twelfth
degree of Cancer, in the ninth yeare compleat, and the tenth currant; The
thirteenth degree of Cancer, ſerveth to the twelfth day after the proper day
of the revolution.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I conſider then the Aſpects of the Planets towards
the ſaid thirteenth degree. Likewiſe, ſo I do of other degrees and
minutes, fitted to thoſe dayes in the which they governe. And ſo much for
Revolutions.</p>
